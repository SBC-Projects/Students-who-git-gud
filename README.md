# Students-who-git-gud

This github project was created as a very basic introduction to Github.

The goal is simple: Clone the project. Add your name to the list. Then push the changes back to Github.

Here are those steps in more details:
1. Create a Github Account and install git
2. Clone this project (git clone *theWebsiteInTheAddressBar*)
3. Add your name to the list manually and save
4. Make a commit (git commit -m "This is my first commit")
5. Push the changes to github repository (git push)

Feel free to edit this README.md and recommend changes here too!
